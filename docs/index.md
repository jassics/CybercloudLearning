## Introduction
Cybercloud Learning is trying to put simple yet practical contents which can be used by beginners or experienced  professionals as a revision or skills update. The goal is to share the knowledge with the cloud and cybersecurity community to better understand offensive and defensive approach on cloud native technologies.

All content on this site is developed by volunteers like us. If you'd like to be one of them, you can contribute your knowledge by submitting a [Pull Request](https://github.com/jassics/CybercloudLearning/pulls). We are open to content from any SMEs or educational institutes. 

Don't worry about submitting content in the wrong format or what section it should be a part of, we can always make improvements later :) When writing content: do try to credit the researcher who discovered it and link to their site/talk.

Please note that we will not explain basics concept or non-security concepts in-depth because our main target is to make this website for security related skills required using other technologies like terraform, cloud etc.
However, we wil make sure that we would cover minimal basic knowledge required to understand any concepts.
