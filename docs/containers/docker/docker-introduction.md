## What is Docker
Docker is a standalone software that can be installed on any computer to run containerized applications
When we talk about Docker, its mostly we talk about Docker Engine.

**Docker has two main editions:**

1. Enterprise Edition (EE)
2. Community Edition (CE)

Docker has an open-source project called "Moby"  to enable and accelerate software containerization.It's source code is available at [github](https://github.com/moby/moby "moby project")

## History of Docker Company
- It's based out of San Francisco
- It was founded by Solomon Hykes
- Started as a PaaS provider called as dotCloud
- That time it leverages Linux Containers
- The internal tool that was used to manage containers was named as Docker
- And dotCloud was rebranded as Docker in 2013

## Docker Images vs Containers
Docker images are read-only templates used to build containers. Containers are deployed instances created from those templates. Images and containers are closely related, and are essential in powering the Docker software platform.

## Docker Use Cases
1. Dev/Prod Parity: When you want the code, environment, software version(s) everything same at both dev and prod
2. Avoid Configuration headache
3. Code Pipeline Management
4. Developer's Productivity
5. App Isolation: for microservice, avoid DDoS
6. Server Consolidation
7. Debugging Capabilities
8. Ease for multi-tenancy approach
